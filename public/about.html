<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Morgane Tacconi, a 23-year-old French developer passionate about web development and cultural discovery. 
  From a young age, I’ve been driven by my curiosity to explore new places and immerse myself in different cultures. 
  I speak four languages—French, English, Spanish, and Portuguese—which I’ve learned by living in places like Singapore, Barcelona, Tenerife, and Portugal. 
  These experiences have shaped my perspective and taught me that happiness comes from being free to live and work anywhere. 
  I’m not afraid to start over; in fact, I’ve learned to embrace the challenge of moving to a new place, learning a new language from scratch, and adapting to completely new environments. 
  This is what motivated me to pursue a career that offers the same kind of flexibility.</p>

<p>I’m currently studying web development through online courses like Udemy’s Full-Stack Web Developer program, 
  where I’m learning everything from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to Node, React, and PostgreSQL. 
  What excites me the most about this career path is the opportunity to blend creativity and problem-solving into solutions that have real-world impact. 
  Although I’m at the beginning of my journey, I love pushing myself to grow, learn new skills, and tackle challenges head-on.</p>

<p>In my approach to work, I believe in breaking problems down into manageable pieces, collaborating with others for fresh perspectives, 
  and maintaining a growth mindset. I’m always ready to learn something new and adapt to different ways of solving issues. 
  My background in international management has taught me resilience, and I thrive on the idea of starting from scratch and learning along the way. 
  For me, every challenge is an opportunity to grow.</p>
